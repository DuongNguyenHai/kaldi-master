/**
   This function arranges the cindex_ids of the computation into a sequence of
   lists called "steps", which will correspond roughly to the commands in the
   compiled computation.  The steps are finer than phases.  (See \ref
   dnn3_compile_steps for more info).  To summarize the properties that
   these steps will satisfy:

  - All cindex_ids within a given step correspond to the same node in the graph
  - All dependencies of cindex_ids within a given step have been computed in 
    earlier steps.
  .
There are also some extra, more obscure properties that the sequence of steps
must satisfy:
  - Any input or output in the ComputationRequest must be in one step, with the
    Indexes in the same order as specified in the ComputationRequest.  (Note:
    inputs can be for nodes of type kComponent as well as kInput).
  - If a step corresponds to a node of type kComponent (and does not
    correspond to an input in the ComputationRequest), then the immediately
    preceding step must correspond to a node of type kDescriptor, and the
    sequence of Indexes in the two steps must be identical.
  - If a step corresponds to a node of type kDimRange, then there must be
    another step corresponding to the source node, with exactly the same
    Indexes appearing in the same order.  (This lets us use a sub-matrix for
    the kDimRange node).

The reason why computation_graph is not provided as a const argument is
that in order to ensure the final property we may have to add a few new cindex_ids.
