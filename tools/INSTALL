To install the most important prerequisites for Kaldi:

 first do

  extras/check_dependencies.sh

to see if there are any system-level installations or modifications you need to do.
Check the output carefully: there are some things that will make your life a lot
easier if you fix them at this stage.

Then run

  make

If you have multiple CPUs and want to speed things up, you can do a parallel
build by supplying the "-j" option to make, e.g. to use 4 CPUs:

  make -j 4

By default, Kaldi builds against OpenFst-1.3.4. If you want to build against
OpenFst-1.4, edit the Makefile in this folder. Note that this change requires
a relatively new compiler with C++11 support, e.g. gcc >= 4.6, clang >= 3.0.

In extras/, there are also various scripts to install extra bits and pieces that
are used by individual example scripts.  If an example script needs you to run
one of those scripts, it will tell you what to do.
